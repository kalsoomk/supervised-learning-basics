## 🔹 What is Supervised Learning?

- "Supervised" means a **teacher is present**.  
- We provide the computer with:  
  - **Inputs (X)** → examples  
  - **Outputs (Y)** → correct answers  
- The machine learns a **mapping rule**:  
Input (X) → Model → Output (Y)

## 🔹 Two Main Types

1. **Regression** → Predict numbers (continuous values).  
 Example: Predicting fuel price, predicting house prices.  

2. **Classification** → Predict categories (labels).  
 Example: Pass/Fail, Spam/Not Spam.
